An update to my introduction to the world of GitHub 20210126

My professional work has always included solving problems that involve data. Coding helps me expand tools and skills I have at my disposal to manage ever increasing volume, velocity, and types of data.  

Most recently I have been learning Python through the "Learn Python Programming Masterclass" course on Udemy.
