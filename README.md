My introduction to the world of GitHub 20-02-2019

Officially, I am new to coding, but I have been laying the foundation for a long time.  My professional work has always included solving problems that involve data, up until the point that the volume and velocity of data outmatched the tools and skills I had at my disposal.  I have nearly completed a Certificate in Business Intelligence and Analytics from the University of Calgary continuing education department.  The focus of this certificate program is the tools, techniques and strategies to bring together people, processes, technology, and data to solve buisness problems more effectively.

  Coding in T-SQL, DAX, M-language
  Design considerations for creating databases, optimizing queries, and writing readable code.
  Dimensional Modeling for optimized query performance - star schema of business processes and conformed dimensions.
  Business Intelligence specific project lifecycle, with a focus on creating an extensible system for all of a business's processes.
  Business Analysis - strategies to effectively define processes, requirements, documentation, and prioritize them.
  ETL and combination of data from various sources to add insights or context.
  Design thought for dashboards.
  Visualization Best Practices - creating clear visuals that effectively communicate data in a purposeful way.
  Exposure to the Microsoft BI Stack of applications: T-SQL, MSSMS, SSIS, SSAS, SSRS, Mobile Reports, and PowerBI.
  Developed interactive dashboards using PowerBI and Tableau. 

My goal is to develop my coding skills, with R as my next target, and showcase my skills in business analysis and how I can leverage data to solve problems and provide actionable insights.
